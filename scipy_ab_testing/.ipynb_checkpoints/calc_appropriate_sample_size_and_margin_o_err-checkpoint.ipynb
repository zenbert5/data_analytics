    "### Margin of Error\n",
    "What does it mean to have “enough” people for a survey? Generally, we are making sure that our results are within a margin of error of the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error is the furthest we expect the true value to be from what we measure in our survey. For example, let’s say we choose a margin of error of 4%. If we get results showing 40% of people love beets the most, we can be confident that the true proportion in the population lies somewhere between 36% and 44%. Thus, the smaller we make the margin of error, the more certainty we have in the results. The larger we make the margin of error, more uncertain we are that they represent the views of the total population.\n",

    "In order to make our margin of error smaller, we will need a larger sample size.\n",

    "### Population Size\n",
    "Our sample should accurately represent the population as a whole. So, when we are dealing with a larger population, we should probably be sampling more people.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is sometimes tricky to determine what the effective population size is. For example, suppose there are 200 people who currently visit BeetsMe regularly. Is 200 the population size for our vegetable survey?\n",
    "\n",
    "If BeetsMe wants to appeal to the tourists that frequently visit Vancucumber, or if they ever want to launch an online store to ship healthy treats all over the world, the real population size is closer to 8 billion (or infinity, really, if we think about the number of humans who could eventually exist and have vegetable preferences). So, for experiments like this, we use the highest population size we can. \n",
    "* Normally, 100,000 will suffice, as changes become negligible beyond that.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Often, for decisions that require extrapolation to an unknown customer base, it is important to understand the preferences of a typical person out in the world, whether or not they are part of your customer base right now. Generally, we use this larger population size of 100,000 or greater instead of focusing on the amount of current customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the small town of Vancucumber is holding an election for a new mayor, and we want to project the results of the election, then the 1700 citizens would be the only important people. In this case, 1700 is the population size we would use in a sample size calculator."

    "### Confidence Level\n",
    "We also need to choose a confidence level. The confidence level is the probability that the margin of error contains the true proportion. For example, if we choose a confidence level of 99%, we can expect that after multiple repetitions of the survey, the true value will lie within our specified range 99% of the time. As we increase the confidence level, we necessarily must have a larger sample size.\n",
